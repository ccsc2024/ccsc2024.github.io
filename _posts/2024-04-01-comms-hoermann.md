abstract: [
        'Friction causes significant energy loss in any moving mechanical device. As the miniaturisation of
    devices reaches the quantum limit, so do dynamical dissipation processes. Fundamentally quantum
    mechanical mechanisms govern friction at the atomic-scale. We account for all relevant quantum
    mechanical effects, such as charge transfer, or van der Waals interactions, by em&shy;ploying density
    functional theory, and machine learning and use the probe particle model to simulate energy dissipation.',
    'Using this approach, we investigate dynamic friction at the natural limit of a singular atom moving a
    single chemical bond. This enables us to explore how the local bonding environment of the underlying
    sample surface affects the energy dissipation that a probe particle experiences. Focussing on the
    example of a CO-functionalised lateral force microscope that measures frictional energy dissipation
    above various organic adlayers on Cu(111), we find strong correlations between the local bonding
    environment and the energy dissipation. Our findings capture the qualitative trends found in experiment.',
    'Finally, we present a mechan&shy;istic inter&shy;preta&shy;tion of our findings that provides insights into the underlying
    physics of atomic/lateral force micro&shy;scopy measurements.'
