title: 'In-Sillico-Lab: Accelerating validation process in wet-lab via front-edge AI technology'
authors: Makoto Takamoto
abstract: 'Recently, there has been a growing interest on AI technology application to material science. 
In this presentation, we introduce our recent activities to accelerate scientific computations which can 
emulates wet-lab experiments. The first one is to accelerate ab-initio MD simulations via machine learning 
interatomic potential (MLIP) models; We propose a new uncertainty-based active learning approach that enables 
to train MLIP model with the minimal amount of the first-principles computation, such as DFT. The second one
is to accelerate Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo simulations. We proposed a self-tuning method to identify the most 
efficient and accurate hyper-parameters for the simulation, which enables us to accelerate 25% speedup with 
requiring 100 times faster tuning time. Finally, we also introduce our latest physics-informed weakly 
supervised learning approach for MLIP models.'
