abstract: 'Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) enable modeling of chemical systems
combining ab initio accuracy with the efficiency of mechanistic force fields. Despite the
great success of ML methods, extending their applicability to larger molecules poses
a challenge partly due to the rapid growth of the dimensionality of the descriptor. State-
of-the-art descriptors include non-essential degrees of freedom or neglect long-range
interactions by imposing a cut-off radius. Thus, finding a way to accurately describe
both short- and long-range interactions without significantly increasing the descriptor
size would advance ML modeling.
In the present work, we propose a global descriptor optimization scheme that can be
efficiently used to model large and flexible molecules. To achieve this, we developed
a robust descriptor reduction methodology by employing sensitivity analysis. We
analyse interaction patterns extracted from reduced GDML models of various systems
of interest, including one supramolecular complex and units of four major types of
biomolecules. Analysis of the relevant features demonstrates that some features
included in local descriptors are not required for accurate models, while certain long-
range features (even beyond 10 Ã…) can be crucial. These results pave the way to
constructing global molecular MLFFs whose cost increases linearly, instead of
quadratically, with system size.'
