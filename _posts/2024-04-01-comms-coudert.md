title: 'Data-based methods to accelerate discovery of novel materials and better understand old ones'
authors: François-Xavier Coudert
abstract: ['The past few years have seen a rapid increase in the use of machine learning (ML)
approaches to the fields of chemistry and materials science, in particular in the
prediction of physical and chemical properties of existing and novel compounds.
Databases of experimental structures—in particular, crystalline structures—continue
to grow at a steady pace and are complemented with larger and larger databases of
physical and chemical properties. We present here several examples of a multi-scale
computational methodology to this problem, by combining the existing tools of
theoretical chemistry (i.e., quantum chemical calculations and classical molecular
simulations) with statistical learning approaches.[1]',
'We show how these have been integrated together in our group and allow not only the
prediction of properties, but also a deeper understanding of the structure/property
relationships that can provide chemical insight.[2] We also highlight the typical
limitations of these approaches, in terms of quality and size of datasets, as well as
accuracy and reproducibility of the methods. We highlight these effects on three
different types of properties of nanoporous materials:',
