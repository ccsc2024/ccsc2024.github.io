abstract: 'The importance and ubiquity of non-covalent interactions in large organic complexes coupled
with their long-range nature account for the challenge they pose to quantum-mechanical
methods as well as machine learning approaches. To facilitate the effort of understanding and
modelling non-covalent interactions in organic systems, we have developed DIM42 dataset —
a high-fidelity dataset containing 42 chemically diverse molecular dimers, each composed of a
large drug-like molecule and a small aromatic monomer positioned at the available binding
sites. The molecular dimers contain up to 65 atoms (with chemical composition including C,
N, O, H, Cl, F, P, S) and their structures were optimised using PBE0 hybrid functional
supplemented with a treatment of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions. Among the
several QM properties stored in DIM42, we exclusively provide the binding energies of these
dimers at different level of theory, including but not limited to CCSSD(T), Diffusion Monte
Carlo, Density Functional Theory, and Density Functional Tight Binding. Furthermore, a subset
of molecular dimers were posteriorly chosen for binding curves calculations at the
corresponding level of theory. The results elucidate the challenges faced by various QM
methods in accurately capturing non-covalent interactions in large molecular complexes, as
compared to high-fidelity benchmarks. We found that the binding energy of the equilibrium
dimers spans the range of 0.2 to 1.1eV independently of the level of theory used in the
calculation. We expect the DIM42 dataset would pave the way to developing and improving
physical and machine learning models for accurately investigating organic systems such as
biomolecules and protein-ligand systems.'
