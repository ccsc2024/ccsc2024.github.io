abstract: 'Noncanonical amino acids are promising for revolutionizing cancer therapy or drug
design via protein engineering, yet their effective integration and targeted design
requires a precise, yet computationally efficient way of modelling the complex
interactions among amino acids in a protein. In bioinformatics, prevailing approaches
rely on energy functions, which draw from knowledge-based and physics-based terms,
albeit often with limited accuracy. High-level quantum chemical calculations could
improve the description of amino-acid interactions, but their computational demands
pose a challenge to conducting comprehensive simulations. Our approach aims to
model intermolecular interactions between amino acids by learning interactions
between amino acids using deep neural networks. In particular, we use the deep-
learning-model PaiNN [1], which we train on a dataset of millions of computed DFT-
based interaction energies with the final goal of designing new noncanonical amino
acids using conditional generative machine learning [2,3].'
