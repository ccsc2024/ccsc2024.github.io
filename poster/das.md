abstract: 'Developing and implementing tools for rapid prediction of catalytic properties can significantly expand 
the search space and accelerate the discovery process. To this end, we present a computational framework aimed 
at accelerating the exploration/optimization of catalyst landscapes by combining concepts from physical-organic 
chemistry, statistical techniques, and optimization algorithms. Our approach typically relies on establishing a 
mapping between the chemistry/geometry of the active site of catalysts and easy-to-compute descriptor variables 
using (non)linear scaling relationships.[1,2,3] The resulting maps then guide us to recognize "sweet spots" in 
the respective descriptor spaces that fulfill the criteria for maximum activity/selectivity. We leverage this 
information to perform straightforward “direct” screening of large libraries of catalysts to identify the ones
with desired properties.[4] Furthermore, the maps also allow new catalysts to be “reverse-engineered” simply by 
inputting a set of desired target properties and then using an optimization algorithm to generate the best 
candidate. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework for multiple case studies including the discovery of 
single-site and multifunctional porous catalysts for industrially relevant catalytic transformations.'
