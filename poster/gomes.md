abstract: 'Photochemical reactions are examples of green chemistry used to synthesize strained
molecules under mild conditions.[1,2] One example is the light-promoted
denitrogenation of bicyclic azoalkanes, which can produce bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane with
retained or inverted diastereoselectivity.[3,4] However, the mechanism behind these
reactions has been disputed for over six decades. We employed multireference
calculations and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations on a series
of diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptenes to address longstanding mechanistic questions. Our
simulations provide detailed information on their photophysical properties, reactivities,
and mechanistic pathways. We used complete active space self-consistent field
(CASSCF) calculations with an (8,9) active space and ANO-S-VDZP basis set.
CASSCF energies were corrected with XMS-CASPT2(8,9)/ANO-S-VDZP. For the
parent and two derivatives with methyl substituents the lowest excitations are nNN(σCN)
→ π* and range from 3.94 – 3.97 eV. We created 500 initial conditions using Wigner
sampling for each molecule and implemented the fewest switches surface hopping
NAMD simulations. We identify four pathways post S1/S0 intersections: the reversal to
reactant, the inversion product exo-housane, the retention product endo-housane, and
a diradical intermediate. Our analysis indicated that the diazoalkanes undergo
asynchronous conical intersections, where one σCN bond breaks along the S1 and the
other σCN breaks after hopping to the S0 (Figure 1).'
