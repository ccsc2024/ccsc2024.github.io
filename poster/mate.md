title: 'Sampling the Grand Canonical Ensemble'
authors: 'Balint Mate, Tristan Bereau'
speaker: Balint Mate 
location: 'University of Geneva'
abstract: 'We consider the problem of sampling configurations of grand canonical ensembles
of Lennard-Jones particles in a box coupled to a thermal and particle reservoir. For
the generation of configurations we use denoising diffusion models, and use the
samples to estimate the excess chemical potential.'
