abstract: 'The synthesis of novel chemical matter remains a crucial challenge in small molecule drug
discovery, often being the critical bottleneck impacting time and cost. Especially C-H activation
reactions on late-stage lead molecules often require high throughput experimentation (HTE)
screening to identify suitable conditions and substrates. [1] Machine learning methodologies,
especially methods that enable efficient learning on three-dimensional (3D) molecular
structures, have proven instrumental in various domains of chemistry. [2,3] We demonstrate
prospective applications of graph transformer neural networks (GTNN) to C-H alkylation and
borylation reactions. We demonstrate the importance of 3D information in predicting
regioselectivity and quantify the impact of electronic information on predictive accuracy (Figure
1). Moreover, we show how trained GTNNs enable efficient in silico library screening to identify
suitable substrates. [5] The identification of synthesizable chemical matter with desired
properties enables fast exploration of drug-relevant chemical compound space.'
