abstract: 'Chemical separations based on heat cost about 20% of the worlds energy.
Finding ways to separate chemicals at ambient temperatures and pressures is
key to the energy transition. Porous materials have proven very useful when it
comes to separations based on non-thermal chemical characteristics. Matching
outcomes from computational chemistry studies to experimentally measurable
properties is the foundation of the materials design pipeline. IAST theory pre-
dicts adsorption behavior of adsorbents in porous media such as zeolites and
Metal-Organic Framework, omitting expensive computations of mixtures with
Monte Carlo methods. Experimentally chromatographic methods have proven
very useful for separation of adsorbents based on adsorbate affinity and binding
stoichiometry, but is limited to studying mixtures. Herein we report the regres-
sion of an Invertible Autoencoder (IAE) for the forward and backward mapping
of pure and mixture isotherms. Pure isothermal binding curves are modelled
as a 3-site Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm, with a broad range of equilibrium
pressure and heterogeneity factors. A synthetic dataset is generated from the
pure isotherms and mixture isotherms calculated with RUPTURA. The IAE
predicts pure and mixture isotherms with high precision in both the Henry and
high fugacity regime, for up to 6 components and 5-site isotherms. This work
contributes to inverting the full design pipeline from physical gas separation to
adsorbate design, enabling property-guided materials discovery.'
