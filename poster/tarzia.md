abstract: 'Cages are macrocyclic structures with an intrinsic internal cavity that support
applications in separations, sensing and catalysis. These materials can be
synthesised via self-assembly of organic or metal–organic building blocks. Their
bottom-up synthesis and the diversity in building block chemistry allows for fine-
tuning of their shape and properties towards a target property. However, it is not
straightforward to predict the outcome of self-assembly, and, thus, the structures that
are practically accessible during synthesis. Indeed, such a prediction becomes more
difficult as problems related to the flexibility of the building blocks or increased
combinatorial space lead to more challenging and more expensive computational
studies.[1] Molecular models, and their coarse-graining into simplified
representations, may be very useful to this end. We developed a toy model [Figure 1]
approach for the exploration of the “stable” space of different cage structures based
on their underlying topologies and building blocks.[2] In our first study, we show the
relationship between a few fundamental geometric building block parameters and
stable cage space. Our results capture, despite the simplifications of the model,
known geometrical design rules in synthetic cage molecules and uncover the role of
building block coordination number and flexibility on the stability of cage topologies.
This leads to a large-scale and systematic exploration of design principles,
generating data that we expect could be analysed through expandable approaches
towards the rational design of self-assembled porous architectures.'
