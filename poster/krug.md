title: 'The Alchemical Integral Transform and its
applications'
authors: 'Simon León Krug, O. Anatole von Lilienfeld'
speaker:
location: 'Technische Universität Berlin'
abstract: 'Within computational quantum alchemy, observables of one system B, such as the
energy EB or electron density ρB can be obtained by perturbing the external potential
of a different iso-electronic system A. We introduced [1] and recently generalized [2]
the so-called Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT), allowing us to predict relative
energies and electron densities. Here, we present the AIT with examples like the
Quantum Harmonic Oscillator and its application to any multi-electron atom of the
periodic table.'
