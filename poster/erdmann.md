abstract: 'The quantification and comparison of Lewis acidity is a fundamental concept in chemistry. A convenient comparison, however, is hindered
by challenges in addressing the influence of molecular charge and solvation effects. 
In this study, we present a systematic analysis of 784 cationic 
Lewis acids, encompassing monocationic, dicationic, and tricationic species, alongside 149 neutral Lewis acids. The fluoride ion affinity (FIA) scale, 
a widely used metric, is evaluated with and without solvation correction [1,2] Our results reveal a charge-dependent clustering of FIA values, necessitating 
an altered approach for a unified acidity ranking. Solvation-corrected FIA<sub>solv</sub> emerges as a robust metric that overcomes charge sensitivity, allowing for 
a coherent evaluation of Lewis acids. 
Further analysis demonstrates the significant impact of molecular volume on solvation-induced FIA damping, providing
valuable insights for designing strong neutral and cationic Lewis acids. 
Exploring alternative scales such as ammonia, LiF, and NMe<sub>4</sub>F affinity and counter
anion effects highlight their limitations and reaffirms the advantages of solvation-corrected FIA<sub>solv</sub> as a versatile and charge-independent 
metric for
Lewis acidity. The general evaluation of Lewis Acidity is further extended by affinity datasets with other reference Lewis bases than F<sup>â€“</sup> 
and compared with experimental data.[3]'
