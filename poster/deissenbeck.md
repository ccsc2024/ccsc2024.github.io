title: 'Reaction discovery with periodic boundary conditions using ab initio nanoreactor molecular dynamics'
authors: 'Maximilian L. Ach, Danish Khan, Anatole von Lilienfeld'
abstract: 'Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is substantial for automotive and exhaust gas catalysis,
reducing toxic nitrogen oxides to molecular nitrogen.[1] For the reduction of nitrogen oxides,
many different possible formation mechanisms are supposed. However, during SCR
dinitrogen oxide (N2O), which is a long-living greenhouse gas, appears as an unwanted side
product.[2] The formation mechanism of N2O involves a chemical reaction network including
complex reaction cascades. To discover unknown areas of this reaction network, methods of
automated reaction discovery are essential. In this study, we employ the ab initio
nanoreactor[3] method to investigate the various reactions occurring during the process of SCR
to reveal a potential formation mechanism for dinitrogen oxide (N2O). To account for the
periodic structure of the framework, ab initio nanoreactor molecular dynamics (AINRMD)
calculations were extended by periodic boundary conditions (PBC) built in Turbomole.[4,5]
Accelerated AINRMD simulations of a copper-exchanged zeolite with PBC were performed
involving key reaction partners of the SCR, such as nitrogen oxides, ammonia and molecular
oxygen. To increase reactivity, the gas phase molecules were accelerated towards the copper
atom. The observed reactions are consistent with the literature and offer insights into a
potential formation mechanism for N2O and a water-shuttled N2 formation. To elucidate the
electronic structure, CASSCF calculations of key cycle members were performed.'
