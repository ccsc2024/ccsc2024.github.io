title: 'Identification of critical internal coordinates to sample reaction paths of enzymatic reactions'
abstract: 'Modeling enzymatic reaction pathways is a challenging and also computationally demanding task. The
numerous degrees of freedom in an enzymatic system, out of which many can be relevant for the
reaction and its energetic profile, at least indirectly, render the notion of “the reaction mechanism”, read
a single reaction pathway, naïve. One promising approach to tackle this issue is by using the transition
network [1].<br><br>
Our system of interest, Carboxypeptidase A (CPA), which contains a divalent zinc ion in its active site,
is an important exopeptidase secreted by the pancreas for digesting intake proteins in the metabolism
cycle. It catalyzes the elimination of the C-terminal amino acid via hydrolysis, with a preference for
residues with hydrophobic side chains. Thus we want to develop a method to automatically sample the
reaction pathways and find the most probable route by an automated choice of degrees of freedom for
the sampling.'

Yellow points mark end states and green dots are intermediate states. White connections with transition barriers indicate a variety of possible pathways. Figure is taken from ref 2. B) Example of a transition network with nodes (reactant, products and intermediates), weighted edges(paths joining 2 intermediates with the corresponding transition energy).'},
