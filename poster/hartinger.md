title: 'The Alchemy of Light: Computational Investigation of Photoswitches and Photomotors'

abstract: [
    'Photochemistry is undeniably fascinating due to its ability to harness the power of light to
drive chemical reactions. At its core, photochemistry explores the intricate dance be&shy;tween
molecules and photons, offering a window into the fundamental processes that shape our world.
Molecular photo&shy;switches and photo&shy;motors stand out as these mol&shy;ecu&shy;lar entities exploit light-triggered conformational changes or rotational motions, offering a remarkable level of control
at the nanoscale.',
    'However, compre&shy;hensively under&shy;standing structure-property relationships of photo&shy;chemical reactions through experiments alone is challenging, if not unfeasible, due to the ultrafast nature
of light-induced processes. Hence, quantum chemical methods have become an indispensable
tool in revealing photoreaction mechanisms and towards the development of design rules within
chemical space. In practice, the applicability of quantum chemical calculations and dynamics
simulations is largely limited due to two main reasons: A) the need for theoretical expertise and
<i>a priori</i> knowledge of photo&shy;chemical properties of the system and B) the high computational
expenses associated.',
    'To tackle these challenges, our aim is to extract the fundamental principles governing photo&shy;chemical reactions through a database-supported analysis of quantum chemical results in
connexion with spectroscopic data. Moreover, science-driven machine learning&mdash;relying on
existing quantum chemical data such as energies, forces and couplings in excited states&mdash;is
employed to predict photo&shy;chemical properties, bearing the potential to greatly ex&shy;pedite non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations while upholding ab initio accuracy.
To achieve these goals, we introduce the <u>S</u>urface <u>H</u>opping <u>N</u>ewly <u>I</u>nvented <u>T</u>raining <u>S</u>et for
<u>E</u>xcited-state <u>L</u>earning (SHNITSEL [1]) database, which contains computational data for a multitude of photo&shy;reactions. Specifically, we showcase example mol&shy;ecules from the compound class
of photo&shy;switches and photo&shy;motors undergoing light-induced E/Z isomerization and directional
rotation, respectively.'
