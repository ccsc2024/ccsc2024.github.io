abstract: 'Contrary to the "the more data the better” dogma of deep learning, publicly
available experimental chemical and pharmaceutical datasets are few in number
and small. To an extent, model transferability can be boosted by including more
physical bias. [1] Fundamentally, however, domain-specific high-quality data is
needed for widely applicable machine learning models. Pharmaceutical companies
have accumulated substantial amounts of curated chemical data. Yet, it is
unrealistic to expect them to disclose confidential information compromising
proprietary data. Even with legal measures in place, companies are reluctant to
share their most valuable data as leaks may occur accidentally. Fully homomorphic
encryption enables processing of confidential chemical data (see Fig.1) while
keeping the data encrypted. [2] This technology may pave the way for synergetic
data-driven collaborations between companies in molecular discovery. We have
published a software-as-a-service demo for predictions of pharmacokinetic
properties of confidential molecules - click [vaultchem.com/demo] to try!'

Our demo enables ML predictions while keeping the molecular input data encrypted during processing.'}]
