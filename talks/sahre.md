decomposition'

abstract: 'We study alchemical atomic energy partitioning as a method to estimate atomization
energies from atomic contributions which are defined in physically rigorous and
general ways through use of the uniform electron gas as a joint reference.[1,2] We
analyze quantitatively the relation between atomic energies and their local
environment using a dataset of 1325 organic molecules. Atomic atomization energies
are transferable across the various molecules, enabling the prediction of atomization
energies with a mean absolute error of 23 kcal/mol - comparable to simple statistical
estimates but potentially more robust given their grounding in the physics-based
decomposition scheme. A comparative analysis with other decomposition methods
highlights its sensitivity to electrostatic variations, underlining its potential as
representation of the environment as well as in studying processes like diffusion in
solids characterized by significant electrostatic shifts.'
