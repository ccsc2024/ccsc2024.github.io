abstract: 'Bayesian optimization (BO) of reactions becomes increasingly important for
advancing chemical discovery. Although effective in guiding experimental design,
BO does not account for experimentation costs. For example, it may be more
cost-effective to measure a reaction with the same ligand multiple times at different
temperatures than buying a new one. We present Cost-Informed BO (CIBO), a
policy tailored for chemical experimentation to prioritize experiments with lower
costs. In contrast to BO, CIBO finds a cost-effective sequence of experiments
towards the global optimum, the “mountain peak” (see Fig. 1). We envision use
cases for efficient resource allocation in experimentation planning for traditional or
self-driving laboratories.'

figuretext: 'Cost-Informed Bayesian Optimization (CIBO) versus Bayesian Optimization (BO). BO
suggests a direct and steep path with expensive climbing equipment and a higher chance
of costs for suffering injuries. CIBO suggests a slightly longer but safer path with lower
equipment costs needed for the ascent.'
