title: 'Machine Learning-Based Potential Energy Surfaces for Molecular Simulation'
authors: 'Markus Meuwly'
abstract: 'In this contribution I will discuss recent advances in conceiving, using, and refining molecular 
potential energy surfaces for atomistic simulations in the gas phase and in solution. The focus is on 
high-accuracy models for which direct comparison with experiments is possible to delineate the range of 
validity of such PESs. Applications range from infrared spectroscopy to the dynamics of bimolecular reactions 
and the characterization of product state distributions, all of which are also amenable to experimental 
investigations. A second topic that will be briefly discussed concerns uncertainty quantification and 
validation of the trained PESs from a numerical perspective.'
