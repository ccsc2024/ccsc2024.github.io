title: 'XAI meets chemistry'
abstract: 'ML force fields have recently become highly popular since they are considered a useful compromise between classical force fields (quick, less accurate) and DFT (slow, accurate).
More and more there is also a growing need to better understand how ML architectures reflect the underlying physics. For this the field XAI - explainable AI may provide the necessary methodology for furthering this understanding. 
In this talk, I will first introduce XAI and then show some results analyzing a number of common architectures for MLFFs and how much they actually reflect physical intuition. '
