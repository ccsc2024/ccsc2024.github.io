title: 'Mean-Field Theory Made Exact through Data-Driven Linear Mapping'
abstract: 'Due to the outstanding trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of density
functional theory (DFT), its combination with modern quantum mechanics based
machine learning (QML) enables the accurate prediction of quantum properties of
many-electron systems with high efficiency. The general scalability of such ma-
chine learning approaches, i.e. predicting electronic structure details of large query
compounds after training on small reference compounds, is still amiss. More im-
portantly, the ever-growing quest for exactness in DFT is a mission impossible due
to the enigmatic nature of the exchange-correlation potential. To overcome these
limitations we introduce the Fock Matrix Machine Learning (FMML). FMML, in-
spired by the linearity of quantum operators, essentially builds a linear map from
the local density based non-local features to the generalized Fock matrix (from
which quantum properties can be directly computed) for any electronic system,
disregarding the nature of the reference method, i.e., being either Hartree Fock
(HF), DFT or correlated post-HF. The density and knowledge necessary for the
mapping is inferred from the reference data of atom-in-molecule-based fragments
(also known as AMONs). We present numerical evidence that FMML simulta-
neously achieves high efficiency, accuracy, scalability and transferability (EAST)
for electronic structure details of novel test compounds. Systems studied include
molecules of varying size spanning the typical organic chemical subspace, poly-
mers, non-covalently interacting systems, as well as a solid. Our findings indicate
that FMML paves the way for computationally feasible, data-driven, numerically
exact solutions to electronic structure problems for arbitrarily sized system, mean-
while bridging gaps between mean-field and correlated methods as well as between
molecular and solid-state domains.'
