title: 'Ménage-à-Trois: Quantum Dynamics, Ultrafast
Spectroscopy and Quantum Optimal Control of
Elementary Chemical Events'
authors: 'Daniel Keefer'

location: 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research'
abstract: 'Modern photochemistry covers a vast application space including photocatalysis,
optically switchable materials, photopharmacology, optogenetics, optoelectronics and
more. Despite the enormous chemical diversity of the engineered materials and
samples, all these processes have in common that photons initially trigger nuclear and
electronic wavepackets at defined molecular units. Understanding this initial
photochemistry and its engineerability at the most fundamental level is thus a
paramount goal in the design of more efficient, robust, and sustainable devices.
The fate of virtually all photoinduced molecular processes is determined by conical
intersections (CIs). These are regions of energetic degeneracy between electronic
states in polyatomic molecules that open ultrafast, non-radiative relaxation channels
that are much faster than, for example, fluorescence. Nuclei and electrons move on
comparable timescales, leading to a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation and a complex interplay of coupled wavepacket motions. CIs can
therefore be regarded as critical junctions in the chemical compound space where the
photochemical decision-making leading to different photoproducts takes place. Our
prime objectives are to simulate (i) the quantum molecular dynamics of these events[1],
(ii) their spectroscopic observables using novel X-ray pulses from free-electron
lasers[2-4], and (iii) how quantum control can be used to steer their outcomes and
enhance the detectability of the intricate, often elusive spectroscopic signatures[5-6].
This “marriage of three” key methods generates a variety of datasets about
photochemical processes, their observables, and their controllability. I will provide
insight into these datasets, in the hope that presentation to this community can
improve their standardization in generation, prominence in other communities, and
their usability by data science methods.'
