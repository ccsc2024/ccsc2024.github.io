title: 'Covalent Organic Frameworks for Drug Delivery'

abstract: 'Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly ordered porous two- or three-dimensional
polymers consisting of regularly connected nodes and linkers and characterised with diverse
topologies, compositions, and properties.[1] Voids inside the frameworks can be constructed
to the desired dimensions and can accommodate a variety of guests: photons and excitons,
electrons and holes, ions and molecules, enabling their uses as catalysts, chemosensors, and
nanocarriers for biologically active targets.[2] In this work we focus on capture, transport,
storage, and release of drugs in/by COFs – a research avenue promising targeted delayed-
release delivery of therapeutics by customisable, responsive, and biocompatible materials. 
We aim to develop a computational approach for predicting the encapsulation and uptake of
drug molecules within the cavities of COFs, leveraging their structural characteristics. Our
approach combines force field (FF)-based Molecular Dynamics, Density Functional Theory,
and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. To further analyse the non-covalent
interactions (NCIs) between the host COFs and the guest molecules, we are also developing
dedicated NCI descriptors and structural fingerprints. Overall, these tools will allow not only
the design of novel materials but also the rapid pre-assessment of their efficacy in applications
related to the sequestration of small molecules.'
