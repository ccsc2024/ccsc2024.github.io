title: 'MEGAN: Multi-explanation Graph Attention Network'
authors: 'Pascal Friederich,[a,b] Jonas Teufel,[a] Luca Torresi,[a] Patrick Reiser,[a,b]'
abstract: 'Most current explainable AI methods are post-hoc methods that analyze trained
models and only generate importance annotations, which often leads to an accuracy-
explainability tradeoff and limits interpretability. Here, we propose a multi-explanation
graph attention network (MEGAN) [1]. Unlike existing graph explainability methods,
our network can produce node and edge attributional explanations along multiple
channels, the number of which is independent of task specifications. This proves
crucial to improve the interpretability of graph regression predictions, as explanations
can be split into positive and negative evidence w.r.t to a reference value.
Additionally, our attention-based network is fully differentiable and explanations can
actively be trained in an explanation-supervised manner. We first validate our model
on a synthetic graph regression dataset with known ground-truth explanations. Our
network outperforms existing baseline explainability methods for the single- as well
as the multi-explanation case, achieving near-perfect explanation accuracy during
explanation supervision. Finally, we demonstrate our model’s capabilities on multiple
real-world datasets, e.g. molecular solubility prediction (see Fig. 1). We find that our
model produces sparse high-fidelity explanations consistent with human intuition
about those tasks.'
