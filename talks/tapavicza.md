abstract: 'Light-driven molecular nanomotors (MNMs) [1] convert light into mechanical energy. 
Due to their temporal and spatial controllability, MNMs have several potential applications in biomedical sciences, including drug delivery and 
permeabilization of membranes [2]. Improving their efficiency requires optimization of various molecular properties. Above all, a high product 
quantum yield (PQY) [3] for the photochemical isomerization that drive the conversion of photon energy into mechanical work is needed. 
This typically goes in hand with a high absorption cross section. Due to improved tissue penetration, near-IR light is the desired source of energy. 
However, due to the excitation energy required to drive the isomerization, this often requires usage of two-photon absorption. Based on quantum 
chemistry and ab initio non-adiabatic molecular dynamics [4], I will report efforts to design new MNMs with improved PQY, one- and two-photon absorption 
cross sections. To allow screening of a large number of molecular candidates, machine learning methods for the prediction of excited state properties [5, 6]
take a crucial role in this development.'
