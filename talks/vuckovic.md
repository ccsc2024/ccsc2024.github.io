title: 'Transferability in machine-learned density functionals '
authors: 'Stefan Vuckovic, Heng Zhao, Elias Polak'
speaker: Stefan Vuckovic
location: 'Department of Chemistry, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland'
abstract: 'The development of density functional approximations stands at a crossroads: while machine-learned 
functionals show potential to surpass their human-designed counterparts, their transferability to unseen 
chemistry lags behind. I will address several aspects of transferability of density functionals, focusing on 
how to define it [1] and how to solve the transferability issues in machine-learned functionals [2].'
