title: 'Functional groups as a language for
property prediction'
authors: 'Mark Heezen, Manuel Alcamí, Clemens Rauer, Freija De Vleeschouwer'
abstract: [
    'Quantitative Structure Property Relationships (QSPR) are powerful tools to correlate
molecular structures with their properties and have been used extensively in the last
decades [1,2]. We aim to use a QSPR approach to predict thermodynamic molecular
properties by using molecular functional groups as structural features. This will lead to
new chemical insights which will be useful for molecular design.',
    'To provide an explainable relationship between molecular structures and their
physicochemical properties, we choose to use conventional functional groups as
implemented in the Checkmol software [3] over generating substructures with
unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms as proposed in [4].',
    'For our method development, we focus on an extensive database of pesticide
structures, developed within the SEPIA-pesticides project (<a href="http://sepia-pesticides.es">sepia-pesticides.es</a>). This
database includes a comprehensive conformational analysis and a full optimisation of
the most stable conformers obtained using the same computational protocol. Utilising
this database, we aim to develop robust supervised learning models for predicting the
vapour pressure.',
    'Looking ahead, we envision broader applications of this methodology in inverse
molecular design, enabling the tailored synthesis of molecules with desired
physicochemical properties [5].'
