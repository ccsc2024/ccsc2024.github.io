abstract: 'Homogeneous transition metal catalysts are highly active and selective. However,
the design of new catalysts for specific asymmetric transformations is challenging
due to the endless possibilities in ligand design. Based on Sabatier’s principle,
molecular volcano plots are a key tool to identify the most promising catalyst for a
given transformation and guide experimental efforts in the right direction. Here, we
will detail the latest generation of molecular volcano plots, including explicit
microkinetic modeling, and combine them with generative models and machine
learning algorithms to navigate the landscape of homogeneous catalysts.
Furthermore, in the NaviCat platform we build interoperable open source tools to
share these methodologies with the broader computational catalysis community.'
