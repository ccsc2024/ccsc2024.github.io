                maybe text should wrap round figure after all!
                maybe there should be multiple ways to place the figures

atz             wide image!

heezen
hoermann        TERRIBLE justification. Maybe need to add hyphenation hints? (HOW?)

GENERALLY:
save local copy of font used for icons! Shouldn't rely on 3rd-party.
is small-caps really a good idea? is text-transform?
